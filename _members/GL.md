I have joined the Nieduszynski Group during my year in industry at the Earlham Institute, Norwich. Here, I am investigating DNA replication dynamics in chromosomal fragile sites (CFSs) in budding yeast alongside my supervisor, Dr Anna Rogers. To effectively replicate these difficult-to-replicate regions of the genome, we have inactivated origins of replication in novel yeast strains to induce replication stress in an analogous way to endogenous CFSs. Further transformation with cassettes which facilitate BrdU uptake has facilitated analysis of DNA replication under perturbed conditions. By performing pulse-chase and arrest/release experiments with these strains and using nanopore sequencing to detect resultant BrdU incorporation, we wish to detect origin firing and measure replication fork kinetics. 

I am currently in the final year of my Integrated Masters degree in Biochemistry at the University of Warwick. Post-undergraduate study, I intend to undertake a PhD and pursue post-doctoral study, inspired by the time I have spent within the Nieduszynski Group.
